## 📚 Overview

This repository contains implementations and documentation for all design patterns organized into three categories:

1. **Creational Patterns** - Deal with object creation mechanisms
2. **Structural Patterns** - Deal with object composition and relationships
3. **Behavioral Patterns** - Deal with communication between objects

## 📋 Pattern Structure (For Each Pattern)

Each design pattern folder contains:

```
pattern_name/
├── README.md                          (Quick reference & overview)
├── src/
│   └── pattern_name.py                (Clean implementation)

```

**What's in each file:**
- **README.md** - Quick overview, use cases, Q&A preview
- **src/pattern_name.py** - Runnable, well-commented implementation
- **docs/PATTERN_GUIDE.md** - Complete guide with examples and Q&A
- **docs/PATTERN_GUIDE.pdf** - Professional documentation for offline use

## 🎯 Design Patterns Covered

### ✅ Completed

#### Creational Patterns
- [x] **Singleton** - Ensures a class has only one instance
  - Location: `creational_patterns/singleton/`
  - Files: `naiveSingleton.py`, `SINGLETON_GUIDE.md`, `SINGLETON_GUIDE.pdf`
  - Status: ✅ Complete with documentation

### 🔄 In Progress
- [ ] Factory Method
- [ ] Abstract Factory
- [ ] Builder
- [ ] Prototype

### 📋 Planned
- All Structural Patterns (7 patterns)
- All Behavioral Patterns (11 patterns)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Running the Singleton Example

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run the singleton implementation
python creational_patterns/singleton/src/naiveSingleton.py
```

### Reading the Documentation

**For Quick Reference:**
```bash
open creational_patterns/singleton/README.md
```

**For Comprehensive Guide (Markdown):**
```bash
open creational_patterns/singleton/docs/SINGLETON_GUIDE.md
```

**For Offline Reading (PDF):**
```bash
open creational_patterns/singleton/docs/SINGLETON_GUIDE.pdf
```

### Using the Template

When adding a new pattern, refer to:
```bash
open PATTERN_TEMPLATE.md
```

---

## 📖 Each Pattern Includes

For every design pattern you'll find:

1. **Implementation File** (`.py`)
   - Clean, well-commented code
   - Production-ready examples

2. **Markdown Guide** (`.md`)
   - Comprehensive explanation
   - Real-world use cases
   - Step-by-step walkthrough
   - Advantages and disadvantages

3. **PDF Documentation** (`.pdf`)
   - Professional formatted guide
   - Easy to read offline
   - Printable format

## 💡 Learning Path

### Recommended Order:

**Phase 1: Creational Patterns** (Object Creation)
1. Singleton - Single instance
2. Factory Method - Object creation
3. Abstract Factory - Family of objects
4. Builder - Complex object construction
5. Prototype - Object cloning

**Phase 2: Structural Patterns** (Object Composition)
1. Adapter - Interface compatibility
2. Decorator - Dynamic enhancement
3. Facade - Simplified interface
4. Proxy - Controlled access
5. Bridge - Abstraction decoupling
6. Composite - Tree structures
7. Flyweight - Memory optimization

**Phase 3: Behavioral Patterns** (Object Interaction)
1. Observer - Publish/Subscribe
2. Strategy - Algorithm switching
3. Command - Action encapsulation
4. State - State-dependent behavior
5. Template Method - Algorithm skeleton
6. Iterator - Sequence traversal
7. Chain of Responsibility - Handler chain
8. Visitor - Element operations
9. Interpreter - Grammar rules
10. Mediator - Object communication
11. Memento - State snapshots
